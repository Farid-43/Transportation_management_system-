Transportation system is a very important part of out country. Proper management of it is equally Important. There is so many transportation and so many passengers as well  , along with different ticket fares based on compartment. Different transportation have different timing and different routes as well. If they are not managed properly, there would be absolute chaos. The objective of the project is to provide solution to this problem by providing a system which would reduce the manual work and help in the management. This project covers all the topics of OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.

In this transportation management system there will be admin and user sections, where admin will get access over all the database, and user will get access only on their self id. The user will be able to search all the trains passing through their place along with timing. The user will be shown ticket fares on selecting particular train according to compartments. The user will be able to book tickets and food for them. The user will be required to enter the passenger details while doing so. The data will be stored in the database, over which only admin can get access to view. The user will also be able to view their own details. The user can cancel their booking if they want to, but they need to do it before a specific time with extra charges. The admin will have access over every database and they can view anything in the system.
